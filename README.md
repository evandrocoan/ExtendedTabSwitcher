Extended tab switcher for Sublime Text
==================================================

**This plugin is inspired by the default tab switcher in netbeans**	 which displays the open files to choose from. View all open files (sorted/unsorted) for switching between them.


## Key Bindings

* On pressing `ctrl+alt+tab` all open files will be displayed for selection.
* On pressing `ctrl+alt+shift+tab` only open files in the active group will be displayed for selection.


User can change the default key binding at `Preferences -> Package Settings -> Extended Tab Switcher -> Key Bindings User`


## Installation

### By Package Control

1. Download & Install **`Sublime Text 3`** (https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
1. Go to the menu **`Tools -> Install Package Control`**, then,
   wait few seconds until the installation finishes up
1. Go to the menu **`Tools -> Command Palette...
   (Ctrl+Shift+P)`**
1. Type **`Preferences:
   Package Control Settings â€“ User`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
   add the following setting to your **`Package Control.sublime-settings`** file, if it is not already there
   ```js
   [
       ...
       "channels":
       [
           "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json",
           "https://packagecontrol.io/channel_v3.json",
       ],
       ...
   ]
   ```
